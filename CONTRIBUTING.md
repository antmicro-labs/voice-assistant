# Contributing

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

* Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
* Problems show where this project is lacking
* With a question, you show where contributors can improve the user experience
* They help in documenting project history

Thank you for creating them.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are, the only way to add code into the master branch of the repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

### Is it of good quality

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well
* I recommend checking spelling with [Grammarly](grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it pass the code review

To merge your pull request it needs to be accepted by at least two other contributors. 
When creating a request please inform devs that you want them to check your code.
Pull request that gets negative comments on its contents will not be merged until all discussions are resolved.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant
This section will be created soon.
